## CIDR
Classless Inter-Domain Routing(CIDR) is a method of assigning IP addresses that improves the efficiency of address distribution and replaces the previous system based on Class A, Class B and Class C networks.

For example, CIDR 192.168.1.0/24 can represent the IP net whose IP range is from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255.

You can refer to [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) for more information.
